This is an attempt at a basic re-implementation of GNU coreutils in Go.

It is just a project used to learn more Go, learn more about coreutils, etc. These tools are not deisgned to be exactly 1:1 with GNU coreutils. Many things like error messages will probably be different. But the functionality (e.g. usage, flags etc) _should_ be the same.

## Status

Done nothing yet!

## Goals

- Create initial (empty) `cp` program
- Create a way to re-use GNU coreutils tests with our example binary
- Start actualy implementing coreutils
